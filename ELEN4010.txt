ELEN4010 has been a wild ride so far! Walking into the first lecture, 
I wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but I quickly realized this course 
dives deep into advanced software engineering concepts with real-world applications. 

The highlight for me has definitely been the simulations. There’s something satisfying 
about watching a complex circuit you've designed from scratch actually work 
Overall, ELEN4010 has taught me a lot about persistence, design thinking, 
and the importance of asking the right questions. It’s not just about getting the right answer,
but understanding *why* that answer makes sense in a practical engineering context. 
Looking forward to the final project — let’s hope the oscilloscope doesn't crash again!
